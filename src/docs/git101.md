## Example of Git workflow

1. #### Clone an existing repository

```bash
$ git clone username@host:/path/of/the/repository/to/clone
```
1.1 Clone an existing repository specifying the branch
```bash
git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>
```
2. #### Move the new files from the working directory to the staging area

```bash
$ git add .
```

3. #### New commit (with HEAD as parent) from staging area

```bash
$ git commit -m "<message-as-present-statement>"
```

4. #### Syncronize your local repository with the hosted repository

```bash
$ git push origin
```

## Branching to create a new feature

1. #### Create the **local branch** to work on the new feature development:

```bash
$ git branch <new-feature-branch>
```

2. #### Select the "_new-feature-branch_" as active working branch:

```bash
$ git checkout <new-feature-branch>
```

- #### Working on feature development:

```bash
<code the new feature>

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add <new-feature>"
```

3. #### Create the new **remote branch** to be reviewed:

```bash
$ git push origin <new-feature-branch>
```

4. #### Review and merge the local branch with the local master and push the updates to remote master:

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge <new-feature-branch>

$ git push origin master

```

4. #### Delete both local and remote "_new-feature-branch_" branches:

```bash
$ git branch -d <new-feature-branch>
$ git push origin --delete <new-feature-branch>
```

## Extra

- #### Inspect the content of the remote repository:

```
$ git remote show origin
```

- #### Pull any changes that was pushed to the hosted repository:

```
$ git pull
```

- #### Take a file from the staging-area and take it in the working directory (keep modifying):

```bash

```

- #### List the _local_ and _remote_ branches:

```bash
$ git branch -v
$ git branch -vr
```
