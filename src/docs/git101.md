## Example of Git workflow

1. #### Clone an existing repository

```
$ git clone username@host:/path/of/the/repository/to/clone
```

2. #### Move the new files from the working directory to the staging area

```
$ git add .
```

3. #### New commit (with HEAD as parent) from staging area

```
$ git commit -m "<message-as-present-statement>"
```

4. #### Syncronize your local repository with the hosted repository

```
$ git push origin
```

## Extra

- #### Inspect the content of the remote repository

```
$ git remote show origin
```

- #### Pull any changes that was pushed to the hosted repository

```
